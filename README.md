(_solution designed During the VIVIDH initiative by B_chain Dynamics)
The name Sakshya is not permanent, and will be changed soon.

## Overview

Sakshya is a document authentication platform with the integration of cloud technology, in order to provide strong security, attack mitigation, and public auditing for transparency.

Sakshya's two main objectives are:

- To achieve **public acceptance** regardless of the user's technical blockchain knowledge
- To empower any kind of public with **blockchain-driven technology** to promote Authencity

## Architecture

Sakshya leverages the advantages of [Ethereum Network](https://ethereum.org/en/), which is a blockchain decentralized application platform that provides hybrid _proof-of-stake_ and _proof-of-work_.

The system creates a bridge between decentralized **Ethereum Blockchain Network** with centralized database.
